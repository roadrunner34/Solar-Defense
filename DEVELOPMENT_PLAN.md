# Solar Defense Development Plan

This document outlines the development plan for the Solar Defense game, a 2D top-down tower defense game set in space. We're following agile methodologies with small, incremental pieces of work.

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Core Game Engine
1. **Setup 2D environment**
   - Install dependencies (Three.js for 2D rendering)
   - Basic HTML/CSS structure
   - Setup canvas for top-down view
   - Configure for GitHub Pages deployment

2. **Create basic 2D scene**
   - Top-down solar system background
   - Camera setup for 2D viewing
   - Basic control system implementation

3. **Player starbase implementation**
   - Create 2D starbase sprite/model
   - Implement rotation controls (mouse/keyboard)
   - Add laser cannon visuals and rotation mechanics

## Phase 2: Core Gameplay Mechanics
4. **Implement shooting mechanics**
   - Auto-firing system (1 shot/second)
   - Projectile physics in 2D space
   - Collision detection system
   - Visual effects for shooting

5. **Enemy spawning system**
   - Define spawn points at screen edges
   - Create predetermined path system
   - Path visualization (optional for debugging)

6. **Combat mechanics**
   - Health and armor system implementation
   - Damage calculation
   - Death animations and effects
   - Credits system for defeated enemies

## Phase 3: Enemy Types & Level Design
7. **Implement basic enemies**
   - Fighter sprites and movement along paths
   - Bomber sprites and behaviors
   - Enemy health display

8. **First level implementation**
   - Wave management system
   - Level progression
   - Simple level UI and indicators

9. **Advanced enemy types**
   - Destroyer and Battleship implementation
   - Dreadnought implementation
   - Carrier with fighter spawning capability

## Phase 4: Upgrade System
10. **Credits UI**
    - Credit tracking and display
    - Sci-fi themed UI elements with rounded buttons

11. **Upgrade mechanics**
    - Sci-fi style upgrade menu UI
    - Purchase functionality
    - Visual feedback for upgrades

12. **Starbase upgrades**
    - Auto-aiming implementation
    - Damage and range boost effects
    - Missile launcher system

## Phase 5: Advanced Features & Polish
13. **Advanced upgrade systems**
    - Target prioritization options
    - Launch bay mechanics
    - Fighter AI following predetermined paths

14. **Game state management**
    - Level progression tracking
    - Game over conditions
    - Victory screens

15. **Audio and visual polish**
    - Sound effects and background music
    - Particle systems for explosions and effects
    - UI polish and animations
    - Tutorial popup implementation

## Phase 6: Browser Optimization & Deployment
16. **Browser optimization**
    - Performance testing
    - Asset optimization for web
    - Cross-browser compatibility testing

17. **GitHub Pages deployment**
    - Setup GitHub Actions for automatic deployment
    - Configure repository for GitHub Pages
    - Create deployment documentation

18. **Tutorial system**
    - Initial popup tutorial explaining mechanics
    - Simple help button for accessing instructions again
    - Visual cues for new players
